# My Personal Website
Over the years, I've had a number of different personal websites, varying from simple to complex,
usually based on technologies I find myself using in my day-to-day work. My latest iteration is
pretty simple and built with Next.js.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
